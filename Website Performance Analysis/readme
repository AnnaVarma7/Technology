🔮 Traffic Forecasting with SARIMA
Created a SARIMA model using hourly session data.
Used ACF/PACF plots to determine parameters (p=1, d=1, q=1).
Forecasted sessions for the next 24 hours.
Visualized historical and predicted traffic trends.

📌 Key Insights
Organic Search brings high traffic but not necessarily high engagement.
Referral and Organic Video channels provide better engagement quality.
Engagement metrics fluctuate with time, suggesting influence of content, campaigns, or time of day.
Forecasting provides a reliable view of near-future website traffic for planning and scaling.
